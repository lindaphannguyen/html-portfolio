<h1>About Linda</h1>
<p>Coming from Vietnam to the States when I was just ten years old, 
  I faced the challenge of adapting to a new culture and environment. 
  This early experience taught me resilience and the importance of embracing change. 
  It's why I've always been driven to learn new skills and explore different paths. 
  After graduating from the University of Texas at Arlington with a Bachelor of Science 
  in Nursing, I embarked on a career as a travel nurse, where I've had the 
  opportunity to continuously adapt and grow in various healthcare settings. 
  Now, as I transition into the business side 
  of the industry, I'm fueled by my past experiences and the desire to keep learning. 
  The ability to adapt has led me to this new endeavor of creating easier access to 
  healthcare for future generations. With a keen interest in entrepreneurship, 
  I'm also diving into web development to develop websites that will aid my entrepreneurial path, 
  ultimately making a meaningful difference in healthcare accessibility and efficiency.</p>
